collisionData:loadData["DNSSFF****IIIIIIII*****SSSSSS";`:raw/NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions.csv]

/ query to show the top places for accidents causing injury
/ bucketed into approx 11m squared area
`injuries xdesc 
  select 
    injuries:sum number_of_persons_injured, last borough
  by 
    lat:0.0001 xbar latitude, lon:0.0001 xbar longitude 
  from 
    collisionData where not null latitude

/ injuries broken down by hour and pivoted on month
pivotOnMonth {select from x where not null month}select accidents:count i by 0D01 xbar time,monthMap month-1 from update month:`mm$date from collisionData where number_of_persons_injured>0

/ injuries broken down by hour and pivoted on month
/ analysing the accidents which had a slippery pavement as it's primary cause
pivotOnMonth {select from x where not null month}
  select accidents:count i by 0D01 xbar time,monthMap month-1 from 
   (update month:`mm$date from collisionData) 
     where contributing_factor_vehicle_1 like "Pavement Slippery"

/ saving data one table file
save `:data/collisionData

/ save as a historical database partitioned by date
/ optimisied for queries on a specified field - borough
/ ensure we are only saving data with a valid date, as we are partitioning on that field
saveAll[`:db;`borough;`collisions;select from collisionData where not null date]
/ saving by year is more efficient for this dataset
/ can partition a datbase on date, month, year or int (int can then be mapped to anything as needed for more unconventional datasets)
saveAllYearDB[`:dbYear;`borough;`collisions;select from collisionData where not null date]


/ you can start up a hdb by loading in that directory into a q session:
q)\l dbYear
q)select count i by year from collisions
year| x
